The `scene` mode composes one district from Kenney's City Kits — Commercial
for the buildings, Roads for the avenues, Industrial for the plant — and
renders it once from the isometric heading, so the look can be judged
beside the current map before any atlas is cut.

The `atlas` mode renders every piece the map uses at four headings and
each zoom level into atlas pages with a JSON manifest: for each sprite
its page, its rectangle and where the piece's ground origin lands, so
the renderer can set it on a cell.

# it. A piece nothing draws is also a piece nothing validates: two of the
# four whose anchors moved most when bug 20 derived them were pieces no
# code named, so that fix was partly measured against art nobody looks
# at. Ten were dropped on 2026-09-25 for exactly that reason (bug 24):
# four industrial building variants, the tank, the windmill, the solar
# panels, two train wagons and the rowing boat.

# as the plant's stack, and item 36 then picked chimney-medium instead, so
# the piece three entries reasoned about was the largest thing here that
# nothing drew. sign-highway-detailed went with it, never drawn at all —

# setting now gives a home to, and the truck is a second vehicle for
# Traffic. That set is asserted by TestAtlasCarriesNothingUndeclared
# rather than only written here, because item 59 existed at all through a
