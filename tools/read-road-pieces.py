"""Which sides each road piece is open on, read off the atlas.

Run this rather than assuming, which is how bug 25 survived three
reports: the premise in recipes.go about the kit's own geometry was a
quarter turn out, and the table was derived from the premise.

  python3 tools/read-road-pieces.py

Prints a piece-by-turn table of open sides, and the check that makes it
trustworthy — every piece must come out with exactly the number of open
sides its name implies, at every turn. pkg/render's
TestRoadPieceOpensWhereItJoins holds roadPiece against these values.


At camera heading 0 the projection is screen=((x-y)s,(x+y)s/2) with +X
east and +Y south, so the tile diamond's upper-right edge faces north,
lower-right east, lower-left south, upper-left west. A piece drawn with
turn T uses the sprite baked at heading (0-T).

The test is the edge midpoint: a closed side has the kit's raised kerb
across it, which is near-white; an open side has road surface, which is
mid grey. A midpoint outside the sprite means the piece does not reach
that edge at all, which is closed by another name — the bend is a
partial tile and that is how it reads.
