"""Copy a scrubbed slice of ~/.claude into testing/helpers/fixtures/<name>/.

The slice is every session with a live record in ~/.claude/sessions, the N most
recently touched transcripts, the smallest bridge-session stub, the most
recent session that spawned subagents, and a pair of sessions that gives the
map a road — one reaching into the other's repo, both ends included, because a
road with no far end is dropped when the city is built. Structure, ids, timestamps, and `usage`
are kept verbatim; prompt text, tool inputs and outputs, thinking, titles,
slugs, file snapshots, and account identifiers are replaced with deterministic
placeholders so the fixture is stable across regenerations and safe to commit.

Layout written under the fixture directory:

  home/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json
  home/.claude/projects/<cwd>/<sid>.jsonl
  home/.claude/projects/<cwd>/<sid>/subagents/*.jsonl, *.meta.json
  home/.claude/stats-cache.json
  home/.claude.json                 (mcpServers only)
  manifest.json
  raw/...                           (unscrubbed copy, gitignored, --no-raw to skip)

Read-only against ~/.claude; stdlib only.
