## Milestones

Each milestone ends with tests green, `make lint` and `make format` clean, and a signed commit.

### 0 — Scaffold

- `go.mod`, Makefile from the workspace template, `cmd/` and `pkg/` skeleton, `.gitignore`.
- `botropolis version`.
- CI: GitHub Actions running `make test lint`.

### 1 — Read model (`pkg/claude`), TDD

- Fixture generator: `tools/make-fixtures.py` copies a scrubbed slice of `~/.claude` into `testing/helpers/fixtures/`
  (prompts and tool output replaced, structure and `usage` kept).
- Parse: live session records, transcript head (metadata) and tail (turn state), `usage` per message, subagent trees, `stats-cache.json`, MCP config.
- Filter the 267-byte `bridge-session` stubs.
- `botropolis status` prints a table straight from the read model — no daemon yet.
- **Done when** the table matches the five live sessions on this machine: state, context %, tokens/hour, needs-you.

### 2 — Daemon and socket

- `pkg/daemon`: initial scan, `fsnotify` on `~/.claude/{sessions,projects}`, debounce, incremental re-read of changed tails.
- `pkg/proto`: snapshot, subscribe, action.
- `botropolis-hook` and `botropolis install-hooks`.
- `botropolis status` now reads from the socket and falls back to a direct scan when the daemon is down.
- systemd user unit and a PKGBUILD under `~/workspaces/aur/botropolis-git`.
- **Done when** a `PreToolUse` hook shows up in `botropolis status` in under 100 ms and the daemon idles under 20 MB.
  Met on 2026-09-17 (r38): 6 ms hook-to-status; 20.1 MB RSS (9.9 MB anonymous, 8.3 MB file-backed, from `/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup`)
  with the parked catalogue loaded for 184 transcripts.
  Getting there needed the daemon wiring split into `pkg/appd` so `botropolisd` no longer links Ebitengine and bubbletea through `pkg/app`,
  and a 16 MiB Go heap cap (`GOMEMLIMIT` overrides it).
  Re-met at r48 after the city hall, file-touch roads and line cards pushed it to 21.4 MB: 18.2 MB RSS (7.9 MB anonymous, 8.5 MB file-backed).
  The live heap after a scan is about 1 MB; the rest was scan garbage the scavenger had not returned yet,
  so the daemon now calls `debug.FreeOSMemory` after every rescan (hook events never rescan, so the 6 ms path is untouched).
  Checked again on 2026-09-18 after the hourly usage buckets and the isometric city: 14.7 MB RSS (4.8 MB anonymous) with 75 sessions;
  `botropolis-hook` (cobra+viper, 12 MB on disk) starts, parses and delivers in 2.6 ms median, so its dependencies are not worth trimming.
  The catalogue had pushed an unsplit r35 daemon to 36 MB.

### 3 — Control

- `pkg/control`: `new`, `attach`, `stop`, `resume`, `rm`, each a thin wrapper over the `claude` CLI.
- Terminal spawning: `BOTROPOLIS_TERMINAL`, else `$TERMINAL`, else a known list.
- A shell function for `~/.bashrc` so `claude` from a shell becomes `claude --bg` + `claude attach`.
- **Done when** a session can be started from `botropolis new <dir>`, its terminal closed, and reopened from `botropolis attach` with the conversation intact.

### 4 — City, first pass

- `pkg/city`: districts as rectangles, buildings as blocks, fill bars for context, pulse for needs-you, hover cards, click actions.
- Sticky layout persisted to `~/.local/state/botropolis/layout.json`.
- Camera: pan, zoom.
- **Done when** every table row from `botropolis status` is a building and every building's hover card shows the same numbers.

### 5 — City, second pass

- Sprites, power plant and lines, radio towers and beams, cranes, roads between districts, day/night.
- Demolish and prune flows.

### 6 — Satellites

- `--tui` client, waybar module, desktop notification on needs-you.
- Second harness adapter (Codex) to prove the seam.
