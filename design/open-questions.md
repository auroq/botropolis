## Open questions

All settled; the decisions are in [../roadmap/design-open-questions.md](../roadmap/design-open-questions.md) and [../roadmap/art-direction.md](../roadmap/art-direction.md).
The history of each is kept here because it explains code that still exists.

- **Foreground-started sessions.**
  Settled 2026-09-18: no "convert to background" affordance.
  The shell helper is sourced, so new sessions start in the background,
  and there is no CLI to background a running foreground session anyway (the CLI's own dialog is mid-turn only).
  Parked-when-you-quit, resumed-in-the-background-when-you-click is the behaviour.
- **Cost and the context window.**
  Settled 2026-09-17: the CLI writes `cost-state` records into the transcript with `totalCostUSD`
  and a per-model token and cost breakdown,
  so the read model takes the last one as-is and never prices tokens itself.
  The context window is inferred, not looked up: a `[1m]` model id or cost-state key means 1M;
  a context that was ever larger than 200k proves 1M (context cannot exceed the window);
  otherwise 200k is trusted only for the opus/sonnet/haiku families and anything else shows no percentage rather than a guess
  (a session that switched to `claude-fable-5-1` mid-way was reading 463% before this rule).
  One API message is written as several `assistant` records (one per content block, `apiBlockIndex`)
  that repeat the same `usage`, so token totals must be deduplicated by `message.id`.
- **`teams/`, `tasks/` and `plans/`.**
  `teams/` is read for roads (member cwds route `SendMessage` traffic between districts); a teams camp is ROADMAP phase 11.
  `tasks/` and `plans/` are not drawn: on this machine every `tasks/session-*` directory is empty
  and plans are slug-named files with no session link, so there is nothing to attach them to.
- **Harnesses.**
  Settled 2026-09-18: Claude Code only; there is no `~/.codex` or `~/.cursor` on this machine.
  The Codex adapter stays as the proof of the `harness.Snapshotter` seam, tested against a constructed fixture
  built from Codex CLI's documented rollout format
  (`~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` with `session_meta`, `turn_context`, `response_item` and `event_msg` lines);
  it is not trusted against the real format and a Cursor adapter is not planned.
- **Sprites.**
  Settled 2026-09-18 in [../roadmap/art-direction.md](../roadmap/art-direction.md): Kenney City Kits, Nature Kit, Space Kit, Car, Train and Watercraft kits,
  pre-rendered from Blender to atlases by `tools/render-sprites`; workers are bots.
  Before that: milestone 5 shipped procedural shapes (vendoring third-party assets was Aria's call),
  then on 2026-09-17 three 16 px Kenney packs (Tiny Town, Tiny Factory, Roguelike Modern City),
  then the same day Kenney's 2D isometric packs for the isometric view.
  Those remain in `pkg/assets/kenney/` until the rendered atlases replace them; the 16 px packs stay behind `--projection top`.
- **Parked sessions.**
  Settled in milestone 5: catalogued by a head-and-tail window read over `projects/*/*.jsonl`, cached by size and mtime,
  aged by `parked_days`.
  `sessions-index.json` was tried as a seed and rejected (cinders: 28 transcripts on disk, 4 indexed).
  Since ROADMAP phase 8 they live in one storage district on the plan.
