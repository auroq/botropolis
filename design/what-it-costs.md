## What it costs

Roadmap phase 18, 2026-09-22.
The daemon was always within its bar; the renderer was not, and redrew the whole city thirty times a second whether or not anything had changed or anyone was looking.

Three things fixed that, cheapest first.
A window nobody can see draws nothing and waits in `Draw` rather than trusting the display's throttle, because a hidden window has no vertical blank left to wait for and a window manager is free to leave one focused while it is unmapped.
The city under the traffic — ground, avenues, beams, district floors, the plaza, the camp ties — composes into an offscreen image keyed on `(generation, camera, heading, view, size, night, labels, hover)` and blits until that key changes.
And a frame whose tick has already been painted is skipped, with the tick itself dropping to ten when `city.Scene.Animating` says nothing on the map moves.

**What the draw order costs** (bug 42, 2026-09-26). Ordering the city back to front used to be one sort on one number per drawable. A number cannot order a point against a footprint — a building spans a range of depths and was being compared as though it were a point at one corner — so the sort is now a first pass and a pairwise predicate corrects it, over only those pairs whose depth intervals and screen columns both overlap. On the agent's rig, 508 drawables: 95.9 µs before, 174.0 µs after, **+78 µs a frame**, or 0.23% of one core at 30 fps. Allocations went from 3 to 1131, which is the edge lists and is the obvious thing to pool if this ever matters.

**Numbers are a measurement of one desk, so the desk is written beside them.**
CPU is `utime+stime` from `/proc/<pid>/stat` over a twenty-second sample as a percentage of one core, taken by `tools/measure-render` on a display that already answers.
Every row carries the frames drawn during the sample, because a cheap app and a stopped one look alike without it.

**The memory column is `VmRSS`, and `VmRSS` is the wrong number.**
It is kept because that is what was measured, and a row relabelled after the fact is a row that has stopped being evidence — but nothing new should be quoted in it, and no two rows in it should be compared unless they ran against the same graphics driver.
Item 61, 2026-09-26: of a client sitting at 357.3 MB `VmRSS`, **68% is shared libraries under `/usr/lib`** — `libnvidia-gpucomp`, `libgallium`, `libnvidia-eglcore`, and `libLLVM` when there is no hardware to avoid it — file-backed, clean, and shared with every other process on the machine that draws anything.
A third of this table is therefore a measurement of a Mesa release.
The city's own memory is `Private_Dirty`, which was **85.7 MB** on the virtual display and **75.4–86.5 MB** on the desk, against `Pss` of 188–254 MB.

**An earlier version of this paragraph rested the correction on two rigs agreeing to within 5% on `Private_Dirty`. That agreement was not real and has been withdrawn.**
The virtual-display figure behind it was sampled from a `--record` run, which accumulates frames and whose memory climbs the longer it runs; the same instrument gives 86 MB, 823 MB and 1.35 GB depending on when it is read and which GL path it lands on.
It was not measuring a steady state and should never have been set beside a desk figure.
Two numbers matching is the most persuasive and least reliable evidence available, because nothing about a coincidence announces itself — and it is worth recording that the retraction cost more than the claim was ever worth.

**What the ruling actually stands on is one rig, broken down by mapping, which does not need a second rig to agree.**
On the desk, drawing: `VmRSS` 388–390 MB against `Private_Dirty` 114.6–116.5, with about **147 MB of NVIDIA and Mesa** that is file-backed, clean, and shared with every GL process on the machine.
That is an argument about what the pages *are*. A page of `libgallium` is not the city's memory whatever either rig reports, and `VmRSS` counts it whatever the window is doing.
So: quote `Private_Dirty`, or `Pss` when a shared page genuinely is a cost, and name whether the window was drawing — a window that exists holds about 77 MB and the same window drawing holds about 115, so a figure without that state attached is missing a third of itself.
Bugs 22, 27 and 28 quote `VmRSS` and their absolute figures should be read as that and not as the city's footprint.

Aria's desk: 1920×1200, the window 636×1120 under i3's tiling, 8 live sessions and 72 in all, 40–45-second warm-up.
The agent's rig: the same machine's `DISPLAY=:0` through a separate daemon, window at Ebitengine's default, 15-second warm-up.
The two disagree on the visible figure by a third on the same commit — different cities on different glass — and agree on the hidden one to a tenth of a percent.

The frame counts are worth reading as a number in their own right.
Thirty a second is the tick; eighteen means `city.Scene.Animating` found nothing moving for two frames in five, so the tick had dropped to ten for that share of the sample.
It gates off far more often on a real desk than the agent's own city suggested, which is to say the tick drop is worth more than the measurement that introduced it credited it with.
A city with work in it always has something moving; a city mostly parked does not, and that is the common case.

RSS is given as a range because it is not a property of the build.
An idle app allocates too little to make the collector run, so memory is handed back explicitly when the window goes quiet — but whether that has happened yet by the time a sample is taken is timing.
One rig saw 236 MB fall to 208 when hidden; the other saw 212 rise to 219 and 224 to 234 across runs.
A virtual display cannot stand in for either *on CPU*: software rasterising turns everything into fill rate, where one full-screen blit shades as many pixels as the sprites it replaces, and no draw-call saving is visible at all.
It does not stand in for memory either, though the reason is different and took a retraction to find: a virtual display may fall back to llvmpipe, whose buffers are nothing like a driver's, and the same command on the same machine measured 357 MB one way and 1.35 GB the other.
An earlier draft here claimed the opposite on the strength of one coincidental match.
`BOTROPOLIS_FRAMETIME=1` reports what a frame costs the CPU and how often the static layer was reused; that is the hardware-independent signal, and it predicted item 2's cut on real glass to within a percent (3.69 ms to 2.30, −38%, against −37% measured).
A gate that is hard to exercise by hand is itself worth recording: i3 will not hand focus to the window from a non-interactive shell, so an unfocused window correctly draws nothing and a naive sample reads the hidden figure whatever it meant to measure.
That is why every row carries its frame count.

Memory: 151 MB of the settled RSS is the atlas on the card — nine 2048-pixel pages — and cannot go without loading it again.
The start-up peak is `assets.LoadKits` decoding all nine pages before uploading any, so both copies are alive at once; a page at a time would fix the peak itself.
An idle app allocates too little to make the collector run, so memory is handed back explicitly when the window goes quiet and after the atlas upload.

### How to measure this, and what does not work

Two instruments, and the second one only because the first cannot be driven from a script on this rig.

**Whole-process CPU** — `utime+stime` from `/proc/<pid>/stat` over a sample, `VmRSS` from `/proc/<pid>/status` — is the number that matters, and it has to be taken with the window open on a real display.
`tools/measure-render` does it, and `--place` implements the i3 recipe: name the focused workspace explicitly, because a window launched from a non-interactive shell lands on whatever workspace i3 last used; float it so the tiling is not disturbed; move the pointer into it, because focus_follows_mouse snaps focus back to wherever the pointer sits; then focus.

**That recipe is not sufficient on this machine, and it took a while to establish why.**
A city window placed exactly that way — X input focus confirmed on it, floating, mapped, pointer inside — draws *zero* frames and costs 0.3% of a core, indefinitely.
A minimal Ebitengine program placed identically reports `focused=true visible=true minimised=false`, so the gate in `watching()` is not the thing refusing.
Neither the frame counter nor the gate's own diagnostic ever prints, which means `Draw` is not being called at all.
So the honest position is that whole-process CPU for a *non-capturing* window cannot be scripted here; it has to be taken by hand, or by whoever's desktop answers differently.

**Frame time** — `BOTROPOLIS_FRAMETIME=1`, which prints ms of drawing every 120 frames — works whenever the run is capturing, because `capturing()` short-circuits the gate.
It is also the hardware-independent number: it counts the work of issuing the drawing rather than the fill rate a software display would charge for.
The catch is that `--record` costs about three seconds a frame, and none of that is drawing: `frame(screen)` reads the framebuffer back off the card, which stalls the pipeline.
That cost lands outside the timer, so the ms/frame figure is clean, but a twelve-second recording takes six minutes of wall clock.

**A guard clause can be false for every case the new code was written to handle.**
Making the five moving things hoverable was finished, tested and would have done nothing: `hoverSprites` consulted the sprite hits only when the world hover was open ground, and `Hit.ground()` is false whenever a building is under the pointer.
A rover stands at a door, a drone circles a roof, a flag stands on one and smoke rises off it — all four are inside or above the footprint of the building they belong to, so the guard excluded every case the change existed for.
It was invisible to the tests, which exercised the new code directly and passed, and invisible to a frame, which would have shown four cards that never appear and sent the search to `noteHit`, where nothing was wrong.
It was visible only by reading the path the call actually takes.
**When adding a case to a function, check what the existing guards say about that case — not only that the case is handled once it is inside one.**

**The instrument must not be inside the thing it measures.**
That has now cost this project three times: a focus gate measured under Xvfb, where nothing is ever focused, so the app idled and the number recorded an app that was not running; a zero-gap measurement of the plant that could not tell *resting on* from *occluded by*, because the plaza is drawn over whatever it covers; and a `pgrep -f "make sprites"` waiter whose own command line contains the string `make sprites`, so it matched itself and could never exit.
The last one has a rule worth stating flatly: **a waiter must never match on a string its own command line contains.**
`pgrep -x`, a pidfile, or `wait` on the job are immune; `pgrep -f "<the thing I am also called>"` never is.

**A run that draws nothing still reports a plausible CPU figure**, which is the trap worth naming: a quarter of a core, spent sleeping, looks exactly like a cheap frame.
Three of eight runs on one desk did that.
So there are two diagnostics behind `BOTROPOLIS_FRAMETIME`, because there are two ways to draw nothing: `QUIET no frames` names which of focus, visibility and minimisation failed, and `QUIET update is running but Draw has painted nothing` catches the harder case above, where the gate never gets a word in.
Every measurement in the table below carries its frame count for the same reason.

### Why the sorted list is not cached

Tried and reverted, 2026-09-22 (`2b4976c`, reverted in `3b7af45`).
The static city is composed once and reused; the sorted list of buildings, landmarks, trees, lamps and movers is not, and that is deliberate.

Caching it means a mover must redraw whatever still thing it passes in front of, or a car is painted over the building it is driving behind.
Redrawing that sprite over the cached layer blends its anti-aliased edge a second time, so a hair of softness spreads across the map.
Three arrangements were measured and all three pay it: the full version changed 29,597 pixels of 3,344,000, the fallback that leaves buildings per-frame changed 19,218, and a version with no transparent layer at all changed 18,403.
The cost is inherent to caching a list something else has to draw over, not a bug to tune out.

What it buys does not cover that.
On the author's rig the full version took 2.7 ms/frame to 1.8; on Aria's desk, with eight live and seventy parked sessions, the same instrument read 2.62 to 2.45 and process CPU moved 19.8% to 19.5% — about two points of a core.
The win scales with how much of a frame is static, and on a real city what remains is movers: cars, trains, drones, workers, sparks.

The conclusion that matters is the one that followed: if what is left is movers, then **hiding networks is the lever**, and the info views of roadmap phase 19 are the performance work rather than a feature resting on it.
