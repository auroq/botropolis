## The city

| On the map | Stands for | Hover shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| District | a project (cwd root, worktrees folded in) | active hours, sessions, tokens, PRs |
| Building | a session | title, branch, model, state, age |
| Lit / dark / boarded-up | working / parked / gone-soon | — |
| Building fill level (storeys in the isometric view) | context window used (of 1M) | tokens in context, last compaction |
| Worker at the bench | the main thread | current tool and file |
| Cranes on the roof | subagents and workflows in flight | count, names, tokens |
| Power plant at the centre | the API | tokens today by model, cache hit ratio |
| Power lines to a building (poles, sagging wires, sparks) | token flow, and that the daemon has the session's hook events: no wire means it has seen none and is reading files | tokens/min; cache-read vs. fresh drawn differently |
| Freight loop round the city, a train per model | the ledger: that model's tokens over the last day, a wagon per unit (the unit grows to keep the longest train to six) | model, tokens, the wagon unit, pro-rated cost |
| A tug on the river | a session arriving (from the north, docking beside its district before its building rises) or leaving (downriver, once it is gone from the map) | the session, its project, its container colour |
| Radio towers at the edge | MCP servers | sessions attached, calls today |
| Beam tower → building | a session using that server | calls this session |
| Streets between districts (autotiled, cars for traffic) | cross-repo file touches, `SendMessage` between sessions | which files, which sessions |
| Library | skills | top skills invoked |
| City hall | `stats-cache.json` rollups | daily activity, model mix |
| Flag on a building | a PR | number, state |
| Smoke | an API error | the error |
| Night | loops and scheduled wakeups running unattended | — |
| Resource strip along the top | city-wide tallies: sessions by state, tokens/h, ~cost and cache hit over 24 h, subagents, MCP calls, PRs, errors | — |
| Ground: grass, dirt, trees | nothing — varied so the eye slides off it | — |

Dropped from bot-crossing: the ship, arrival and departure walks, idle pottering,
size-by-transcript, and the desktop-app "unread" flag.

## Rendering

2D top-down with pre-rendered, y-sorted sprites — the Factorio approach.
Ebitengine, so the whole project stays in Go.
First pass is flat coloured shapes with text; sprites (Kenney CC0 city and isometric packs to start) come once the model is right.

## View

The map is isometric by default (Kenney's isometric packs; `--projection top` keeps the 16 px top-down view).
Isometric 2:1 is an affine projection, so `pkg/city` keeps rectangles and only the renderer sees diamonds.
Below a detail zoom the map view draws flat state-coloured blocks, the way Factorio's chart replaces sprites with map colours;
above it, buildings are stacked from the pack's ground floors, storeys and roofs.
Parked sessions used to sit in a yard inside each district; since the plan (below) they sit in one storage district.
Labels are fixed-size and sit on the floor or above the kerb, never over what they name.

## City plan

Phase 8 of the roadmap, 2026-09-18.
`pkg/plan` is a pure function from the live districts' sizes in cells, the tower count and the storage rows to where everything goes:
a plaza at slot (0,0), rings of slots around it whose columns and rows are sized to the largest block in them so the avenues run straight,
a district's slot remembered in `layout.json` while it stays live and replaced from the innermost ring when another took it,
unused slots as park blocks, a two-cell park belt, a telecom ridge along the north, storage along the south, the river down the east edge.
Every avenue exists whether or not a road's traffic is routed along it; a lamp stands at every crossing; a tree stands on every park cell;
the fountain is the plaza's centre cell.
`pkg/city` converts cells to pixels, routes each road's traffic along the avenues from kerb to kerb (a road between neighbours runs the shared avenue),
puts the plant, hall and library on the plaza and one shed per parked session in storage, grouped by project.
The lake, the hashed river and the per-cell hashed grass, dirt and trees are gone; beyond the plan's edge there is nothing,
and the camera clamps so the plan stays under the middle of the window.
