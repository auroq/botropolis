// The zoom ladder and the atlas have to agree about how far in the map
// can go, and nothing makes them: the ladder is a list of numbers in
// pkg/city and the atlas is a set of files in pkg/assets.
//
// They disagreed. The ladder went to 4 and the atlas stops at 2, so at
// zoom 3 and 4 there was no sprite and z2 was stretched 1.5x and 2x.
// Every piece blurred; the cooling tower showed it worst only because a
// large smooth curved surface cannot hide upscaling the way a box can,
// which is why it was reported as "the tower is low res" rather than as
// a defect of the whole map.
//
// Cutting the missing levels was budgeted before capping the ladder: z3
// wants 14 pages and z4 wants 23, against a budget of 8 each and z2's 6.
// So the ladder stops where the art does, and this holds it there.
