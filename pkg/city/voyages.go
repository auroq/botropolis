// layout, so the river moves whenever the city is re-planned — and it
// moves for far less than a new district. A second session in a project
// that already exists shifts it a whole cell, 48 units. A tug holding
// points captured at launch was then sailing a river that no longer
// existed, and when the map shrank those points lay past its east edge,
// where there is nothing to draw: Aria's "teleports off the river into
// the black".
//
// So the ends are parameters — which end of the river, and whose dock —
// and Voyages resolves them against the live city on every read. The
// invariant then holds at every read rather than at every write, which
// is the difference between a value that cannot drift and one that only
