// Bug 42. A footprint eight units deep was being compared as though it
// were a point at one of its corners, and no single scalar can order a
// point against a box in this projection: keying the box at its back
// corner lets everything behind it draw over it, keying it at its front
// corner lets it draw over everything in front. What does work is a
// pairwise predicate — a is hidden by b when a ends before b begins on
// one of the two axes, in the camera's own frame.
