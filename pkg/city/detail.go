package city

// How much of the city is drawn.
//
// The scenery — the trees along every avenue, the lamps, the planting in
// the district yards — is the largest single thing in a frame by count,
// and none of it means anything. It is there because a city with no
// trees does not read as a city, which is a real job and worth the
// pixels most of the time. But it is the first thing to give up on a
// laptop on battery, or on a map projected on a wall across the room,
// and it is the only part of the map whose absence costs no information
// at all.
//
// One setting, not a checkbox per kind. A row of tick boxes for trees,
// lamps and bushes would be three ways to ask the same question, and
// each of them would have to be explained.

// Detail is how much scenery is drawn.
