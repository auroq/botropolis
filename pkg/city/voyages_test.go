// Bug 54a. Aria: "Even with one boat, it still makes things refresh
// weird and the boat teleports off the river into the black."
//
// A voyage captured From and To as absolute world points when it was
// created and interpolated between them forever. The river sits at the
// map's east edge and the map's width follows the block layout, so the
// river moves whenever the city is re-planned — and measurably it moves
// for far less than a new district: a SECOND SESSION IN A PROJECT THAT
// ALREADY EXISTS shifts it one cell, 48 units. Any tug in flight was
// then sailing coordinates belonging to a river that no longer existed,
// and when the map shrank those coordinates were past its east edge,
// which is the black she saw.
//
// The endpoints are resolved from the live RiverBand on every read now,
// so a re-layout carries its boats instead of stranding them. Progress
// is time-based, so a tug keeps its place along the run and re-anchors.
