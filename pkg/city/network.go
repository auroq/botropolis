// them. Wires from the plant, beams from the towers, cars on the
// avenues, the freight loop, the cranes over a building.

// Drawing all of them at once is why the map reads busy, and it is also
// most of what a frame costs — the networks are the movers, and the
// movers are what is left after the still city is composed once. Putting
// each behind the view that asks about it is the same decision twice:
// the map says less at a glance, and Attention stops paying for four
// answers nobody asked for.

// Network is one of them.
