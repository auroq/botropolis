// Contextual highlight: what the thing under the pointer is tied to.
//
// It is the answer to a question colour cannot carry. Thirteen MCP
// servers cannot be thirteen hues — the map caps at three — so Servers
// is legible a different way: put the pointer on a tower and the
// sessions that call that server stay lit while everything else steps
// back. "What breaks if this goes down" is a set, and a set is better
// shown than coloured.
//
// It rides the same machinery a view does. Receding is what the renderer
// already knows how to do; this only decides which objects are spared,
// which is why it works in Attention as well as inside a view.

// Highlight is the lit set. Active is false when the pointer is on
// nothing, which is the common case and must cost nothing.
