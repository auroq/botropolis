// The refresh courier. Item 56.
//
// Aria, on r265: "Still don't see the refresh boat (to be clear the
// usage boats are there just not the refresh boat when I press u)."
//
// She was looking for something bug 54 removed. Until then a refresh
// put a boat on the river, but only by accident: `claude -p` is a real
// Claude Code session while it runs, so the probe got a tug the way any
// session does — and that is exactly why it dragged the map around and
// had to go. The event deserved a boat; the accident was not the only
// way to get one.
//
// A Courier is not a session. It has no district, no dock, no entry in
// snapshot.Sessions, and nothing in it reaches the plan — so it cannot
// move the river, because it is not part of what sizes the map.
// Everything bugs 54 and 54a fixed stays fixed.
//
// It also does not track the subprocess. Aria: "Even if the command
// completes, we should still render the boat all the way across." The
// probe finishes in about a second, and a boat that vanished a second
// after launching would be the despawn she already rejected. It means
// "you asked for fresh numbers", not "a subprocess is running".
