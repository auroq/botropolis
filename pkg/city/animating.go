// Whether anything on the map is moving under its own steam.
//
// The renderer paints at a tick, and a tick faster than the eye needs
// is work thrown away. Nothing here is about what the map means — it is
// about whether the next frame could differ from this one — so the
// answer lists every object that moves between frames and nothing else.
//
// Three things are deliberately not in the list, and they are written
// down because a list that claims to name everything cannot leave the
// reader guessing whether an absence is a decision or an oversight.
// Item 64 was exactly that: the courier was missing from here, and
// nothing distinguished its absence from the two below.
//
// The fountain steps through three spray frames a second apart, which a
// slow tick renders exactly. The lamps' night glow is fixed by the zoom
// and the hour, not by the clock between frames. And the usage gauges
// hold still on purpose — `gaugeAt` takes no clock, so a gauge's
// position along the river *is* its reading, and a boat that drifted
// between frames would be lying about the number.

// Animating reports whether anything is in motion: a tug on the river,
// a refresh courier crossing it, a train on the loop, a car on an
// avenue, a drone over a roof, a worker at a door, a beacon pulsing,
// smoke rising, or a merge being celebrated. With motion reduced the
// clock stands still and nothing is, whatever is on the map.
