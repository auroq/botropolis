// The five things on the map that move, and what each one means.
//
// Every other object here could be asked what it stood for: a building,
// a district, a landmark, a road, a beam, a wire. These five could not,
// and the cost of that was not theoretical — the person who designed the
// map could not tell a drone from a car, and did not know what the flags
// were. Three of the five are vehicles, which is most of why they
// blurred into each other.
//
// So the rule in §1 — every object means one datum, and hovering it
// shows the number it stands for — now holds for everything that is
// drawn rather than for everything that stands still. A card that has to
// be explained in prose somewhere else is a card the map is not carrying.

// WorkerCard is the rover at a door: the session's own main thread. It
// waits at the door while the session is mid-turn and drives out to the
// kerb and back for each tool call, which is the whole of what a trip
// means.
