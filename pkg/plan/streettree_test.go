// Bug 41. Aria: "several trees still land in concrete at the edge of
// properties". Not the jitter — TreeJitter is 0.3 against a half-cell
// of 0.5, so a park tree cannot leave its cell. A street tree was
// planted on a street cell and pushed KerbOffset 0.42 off centre, and
// 0.42 is also inside the cell, so it reached the far edge of the
// tarmac rather than a verge. The constant's comment described a verge
// that was never built.
//
// Bug 20's guard tested cells, and these trees are on a legal cell, so
// the guard has to be on where the tree actually ends up.

// lands is the cell a tree finally stands in, once its offset is taken
// into account.
