// a number means nothing without the number beside it. This is that, laid
// out: the view's name, then either a swatch and a label per category or
// a gradient bar with its two ends written out.
//
// It sits above the key row and takes no room at all when no view is up,
// so entering and leaving a view never moves the map.
