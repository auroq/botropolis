// The usage gauges' layout. Bug 52: the percentage is read *along* the
// river and the boats are separated *across* it, which is the way round
// Aria asked for — "going bottom to top and face that direction", and
// "spread out left to right as well". Item 49 had the two swapped, so
// the reading sat on the river's shortest dimension and the long axis
// carried nothing.
//
// Both are pure arithmetic on a width and a count, so they live here
// and pkg/render decides where on the water that lands.

// GaugeLanes are the offsets from the river's centre line at which
// boats ride, one lane each, so that boats with equal readings are
// still told apart. beams is each boat's width in lane order, and
// margin is the water left between a hull and the bank.
//
// The outer lanes are pinned by their OWN half beam plus the margin,
// not by the widest hull's. Bug 55: reserving the widest at both sides
// put the widest hull exactly half a beam from the bank — a clearance
// of zero, arrived at by construction rather than chosen by anyone, so
// the liner's superstructure sat over the grass. Pinning each end by
// the hull that actually rides there recovers the room the narrow boat
// was never using, which is what pays for the margin.

// legible way to say "at or past it" without needing the number.
