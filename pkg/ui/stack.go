// StackFittings is the curb where a flue passes through a flat roof:
// a low ring round the opening that the roofing turns up against.
// Bugs 46, 46a and 46b.
//
// The geometry, which is the whole of it. A cylinder meeting a
// horizontal plane intersects it in a circle, and a circle on the
// ground plane of a 2:1 projection is an ellipse as wide as the stack
// and half as tall. So the stack's visible bottom boundary is an arc
// bulging downward, and the sprite's own straight bottom edge is the
// one shape it cannot be.
//
// A ring of radius R round a stack of radius r is hidden only where it
// passes behind the stack, which is 2·asin(r/R) — at R = 1.32r that is
// 98°, leaving 262° visible. It wraps well past the horizontal diameter
// and its ends disappear behind the stack's silhouette rather than
// stopping in mid air, which is what made the first curb read as a
// detached crescent. None of that is computed here: the ring is drawn
// whole and the stack is drawn over it, so the occlusion falls out of
// the ordering.

	// 63 at row 123, which is where the cut actually lands. The sprite
