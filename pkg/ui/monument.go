// Monument is the sign that stands outside an office plaza, built to
// the grammar of Aria's references in docs/references: coursed stone
// piers either side of a recessed panel, a cornice oversailing them,
// and a base course at the ground. Bugs 44 and 45.
//
// It faces the viewer rather than lying in the world's plane. Type
// sheared into a 2:1 projection is hard to read at any size, so the
// face is a rectangle in screen space and the copy sits level. What
// stops that reading as a decal is not the angle but the depth: the
// piers keep their returns, the cornice keeps a visible underside, and
// the whole thing casts a contact shadow onto the ground it stands on.
//
// Two rules define the object and are asserted rather than commented. A
// monument is low and landscape, and it is a mass sitting on the earth
// — a panel floating clear of its base is a pylon sign, which is the
// failure mode.
