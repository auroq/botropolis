// The city under the traffic. Ground, avenues, tower beams, district
// floors, the plaza and the camp ties do not change between frames
// unless the city, the camera or the view does — and they are most of
// the drawing. Composed once into an offscreen image and blitted, they
// cost one draw call a frame instead of thousands.
//
// The power lines are not among them although they are painted in the
// same place: their sparks travel with the clock, so they would freeze.
//
// Only the layers painted before the sorted list live here, and that is
// deliberate rather than a first cut: everything in the sorted list is
// interleaved with the things that move, so lifting it out would paint
// a car over the building it is driving behind. Caching that half needs
// the movers to redraw the static pieces they pass in front of, which
// is its own piece of work.

// layerKey is everything the static layer depends on. When it changes
// the layer is composed again; while it holds, the layer is a blit.
