// Bug 45. A project's name stands at the near corner of its lot as a
// monument sign, built to the grammar of the references in
// docs/references: coursed piers either side of a recessed panel, a
// cornice oversailing them, a base course at the ground.
//
// It faces the viewer. Type sheared into a 2:1 plane is hard to read at
// any size, so making the sign bigger would only have produced bigger
// slanted type; turning the face square to the screen is what fixes it.
//
// Facing the viewer is also what got the item 4 billboards and the item
// 40 plate rejected, so the difference has to be earned rather than
// assumed. A decal is what was rejected, not a head-on object. Three
// things keep this a solid: the piers and cornice keep visible returns,
// the cornice keeps a darker underside, and the sign casts a contact
// shadow on the ground. It is a drawable on its own footprint, so it
// occludes and is occluded like anything else — it is not painted last,
// which is the thing that made the plate chrome.
