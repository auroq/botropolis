// Bug 52. The axes are the other way round from item 49: the percentage
// is read ALONG the river and the boats are separated ACROSS it.
//
// Aria: "The boats should be going bottom to top and face that
// direction. They shouldn't all be in the same line. They should be
// spread out left to right as well."
//
// Every test here that loops the four headings is guarding the same
// ruling as bug 45's: a gauge whose direction reverses when the camera
// turns is worse than no gauge. The along-river axis genuinely does
// point up the screen at two headings and down at the other two, so
// which end reads 0% is chosen per heading rather than fixed to a bank.

// A run of river to read against: north end first, as city.RiverBand
// returns it.
