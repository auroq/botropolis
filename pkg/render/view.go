// Drawing the city in an info view.
//
// The view is subtractive: it shows one dimension and takes the rest
// away. Two things make that readable. The city under it recedes — it
// is drained of colour and darkened, because saturated colour carries
// more weight than muted and the overlay only reads if the base steps
// back. And each object that has a value in this view is painted in the
// view's own colour over the top.
//
// Something with no value in the view is left receding rather than
// painted at one end of the scale. An unknown cost is not a cost of
// nothing, and a session that calls no servers is not calling the first
// one in the list.

// blitBase puts the composed city on the screen, drained of colour
// when a view is up. Saturation is what carries visual weight, so
// taking it out of the base is what lets the overlay read — and it is
// done here, once, on the way to the screen, rather than tinted into
// every layer that went into it.
