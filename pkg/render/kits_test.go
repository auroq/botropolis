// Bug 53. Aria: "The boats get smaller at a certain zoom. We don't need
// to do that."
//
// kitSized states a size and works the scale back from the art, which
// is what item 51 needed. It did that in SCREEN pixels, so the sprite's
// own size cancelled out of the arithmetic and the drawn size came to
// depend only on cam.Zoom/atlas.Zoom. atlas.Zoom is a step function, so
// at the point where the z2 cut takes over, the ratio halves and the
// boat halves with it. No threshold was ever written; the boundary is
// the whole of the bug.
//
// Every other piece survives that step because the ladder's
// normalisation is the point of the ladder: a z2 sprite is about twice
// its z1 cut, which cancels the halved ratio. kitSized opted out of
// that, and this is the guard that it has opted back in.
