// atlasReserve is every piece cut into the atlas that nothing draws yet,
// and why it is still worth its area. Bug 24 kept seven on this footing
// and wrote down that any of them without a caller a phase later should
// go; item 59 is that phase arriving, and chimney-large and
// sign-highway-detailed went.
//
// The list is here rather than in a comment because a comment is not
// checked. PIECES in tools/render-sprites/render.py and the sprite names
// in this package are two things that must agree, and until now nothing
// made them: chimney-medium quietly left the reserve by being drawn in
// item 36, which left the comment describing a set it no longer had.

// sourceLiterals is every string literal in every tracked non-test .go
// file, which is where piece names are spelled. Scanned rather than
// searched as text, and walked rather than shelled out to git: a test
// that runs a subprocess is a test that can fail for reasons that are
// not the code's.
//
// Two exclusions, and both are what make these three tests able to fail.
//
// _test.go is excluded because atlasReserve below spells all six of its
// pieces as quoted literals, so a corpus containing this file finds every
// reserved piece "drawn" and agrees with itself: the reserve can never be
// caught going stale, which is the one thing it exists to catch. Verified
// by mutation — car-kit/truck added to kitCars, making a reserved piece
// genuinely drawn, left the suite green until item 59's correction.
//
// Comments are excluded because go/scanner never emits them as tokens,
// and item 68 is why that matters: a raw text search counted the doc
// comment on assets.KitAtlas.Sprite, which names
// "city-kit-commercial/building-a" as its illustrative example, as a
// caller. Dropping that piece from kitCommercial while the comment stood
// left the guard green; deleting eight words of prose in another package
// turned it red. Prose is not a caller, and the convention of quoting a
// real name in a doc comment is worth keeping, so the corpus gives way
// rather than the comment.
//
// The general shape both times: a corpus that includes the test will
// always agree with the test, and a corpus that includes prose will
// agree with whatever the prose happens to mention. Scanning for
// token.STRING settles comments, doc examples, //go:generate lines and
// struct tags in one move, and makes the match exact rather than a
// substring.
