// The usage gauges: boats on the river. Item 49, axes corrected by bug
// 52.
//
// The percentage is read ALONG the river — one end 0%, the other 100%,
// bow pointing at 100% — and the three boats are held apart ACROSS it,
// a lane each. Aria: "The boats should be going bottom to top and face
// that direction. They shouldn't all be in the same line. They should
// be spread out left to right as well."
//
// Item 49 had these the other way round, which is why "where is 0% and
// 100%?" had no answer on the frame: the reading ran across a river two
// cells wide, the shortest dimension available, while the long axis
// carried nothing at all. On this axis the resolution problem that
// forced the widening stops existing — a 25% step is tens of cells
// rather than tens of pixels — and the boats stop travelling, because
// their position along the river IS the reading. A gauge that drifts
// cannot be read.

// bowHome is the world direction a hull's bow points when it is drawn
// unturned.
//
// Set by eye against a frame, and it has to be. The geometry does not
// determine it: on ship-cargo-a the tallest structure and the hull's
// narrowest slice point in opposite directions, so "the bridge is aft"
// and "the hull tapers forward" disagree, and the liner tapers at both
// ends so its outline has no bow to find at all. For "which way does
// this face", a person looking at the picture is the specification.
//
// It is south, and r254 shipped it as north. I decided the cargo ship's
// yellow deckhouse was its stern by convention, then read a frame
// expecting to see that and saw it. Aria looked once: "the boats are
// faced backwards". Taking the deckhouse as the BOW instead, the four
// cut rotations agree — it sits left at rotation 0, top-left at 90,
// right at 180 and bottom-right at 270, and south is the one world
// direction that projects to all four of those at their headings.
//
// If this ever looks wrong again, check it against a frame rather than
// against the model. The model cannot settle it.
