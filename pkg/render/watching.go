// Whether anyone can see the window, and what to do when nobody can.
//
// Focus alone is not the question, and gating on it alone made things
// worse rather than better: i3 holds a window in its scratchpad
// focused while it is unmapped, so a gate on focus never closes — and
// an unmapped window is exactly where the cost runs away, because the
// buffer swap stops blocking on the compositor and the loop free-runs
// as fast as it can. Measured on a desktop, hidden cost 50.3% of a core
// against 35.6% for a window in plain sight.
//
// So the loop is throttled here rather than left to the display: when
// nobody is watching, Update sleeps and Draw paints nothing. That holds
// whatever the window manager thinks focus means and whether or not
// there is a vertical blank to wait for.
