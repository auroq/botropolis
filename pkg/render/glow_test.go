// than either and a column of them saturates to white. At fit that is
// the point — what matters is which lights are on, not their size — but
// the radius grows with the zoom and the storeys it sits between do not
// grow faster, so at zoom 2 and above a five-storey building wore five
// merged discs and vanished behind its own windows.
