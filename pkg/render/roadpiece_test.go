// What the kit's road pieces actually look like, measured off the atlas
// rather than assumed.
//
// Each sprite was read at all four baked headings and its open sides
// taken from the tile diamond's edge midpoints: a closed side carries
// the kit's raised kerb, which is near-white, and an open side is road
// surface, which is mid grey. The check that the method is sound is that
// every piece came out with exactly the number of open sides its name
// implies, at every turn — a straight always two, a T always three.
//
// At camera heading 0 the projection is screen = ((x-y)s, (x+y)s/2) with
// +X east and +Y south, so the diamond's upper-right edge faces north,
// lower-right east, lower-left south and upper-left west.
