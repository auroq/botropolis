// What a frame costs the CPU, and how often the static layer is reused.

// This is the number to optimise against, and it needs saying why. A
// virtual display draws in software, so measuring the process there
// measures fill rate — how many pixels Mesa shaded — which caching does
// not change: one full-screen blit shades as much as the sprites it
// replaces. On a real graphics card the pixels are free and the cost is
// the work of issuing the drawing, which is what this counts.
//
// Set BOTROPOLIS_FRAMETIME=1 and it prints a line every reportEvery

// A window that paints no frames still reports a plausible-looking CPU
// figure — a quarter of one core, spent sleeping — and the only symptom
// is a number that means "an app that was not running" while looking
// like a measurement. Three of eight runs on one desk did exactly that.
// So there are two reports, because there are two ways to draw nothing
// and they need telling apart.

// quiet is the first: the window is there and the loop is running, but
// nobody is watching it, and it says which of the three conditions
// failed.
