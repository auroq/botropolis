// Bug 43. The footer's verbs answer the mouse as well as the keyboard,
// and a click stands in for its key rather than calling the action
// itself: Game.just reads g.clicked alongside the real keyboard, so the
// click runs the keyboard's own path. A second copy of each action
// would be two things that must agree with nothing forcing them to,
// which is the shape this project has paid for six times.
//
// It also keeps Aria's reason intact — "it enables things to be
// discovered while learning controls". The verb goes on showing its
// key, because the key is what the click presses.

// footerSynonyms are the verbs whose chip is not the name of a key.
// Anything not here and not a key name — drag, wheel, click — is not
// clickable, because there is no key for it to press.
