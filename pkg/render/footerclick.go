// Bug 43. The footer's verbs answer the mouse as well as the keyboard,
// and a click stands in for its key rather than calling the action
// itself: Game.just reads g.clicked alongside the real keyboard, so the
// click runs the keyboard's own path. A second copy of each action
// would be two things that must agree with nothing forcing them to,
// which is the shape this project has paid for six times.
//
// It also keeps Aria's reason intact — "it enables things to be
// discovered while learning controls". The verb goes on showing its
// key, because the key is what the click presses.

// footerSynonyms are the verbs whose chip is not the name of a key.
// Anything not here and not a key name — drag, wheel, click — is not
// clickable, because there is no key for it to press.
var footerSynonyms = map[string]ebiten.Key{
	"?":   ebiten.KeyF1,
	"esc": ebiten.KeyEscape,
}

// clickFooter presses the verb under the cursor, if there is one.
func (g *Game) clickFooter(cursor city.Point) bool {
	g.mu.Lock()
	bar := g.footerBar
	g.mu.Unlock()
	hit, ok := bar.Hit(cursor)
	if !ok {
		return false
	}
	key, ok := footerSynonyms[hit.Key]
	if !ok {
		key, ok = keyByName(hit.Key)
	}
	if !ok {
		// A verb with no key behind it — drag, wheel, click. The click
		// still lands on the bar rather than falling through to the
		// map, because the bar is what the pointer is over.
		return true
	}
