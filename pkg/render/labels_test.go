// Labels that claim things, held against the things they claim.
//
// The footer said "click attach" while a click attached, and went on
// saying it after a click stopped attaching. That is the one shape in
// this project that cannot be fixed by making one side derive from the
// other — a verb in a key row cannot be computed from what the code
// does without something silly — so it has to be tested instead.
//
// The map is full of labels of this kind now: the footer's verbs, the
// view key's nine questions, a legend's aggregate, five mover cards.
// Each is a promise that can quietly stop being true.
//
// These are the ones that can be checked cheaply. The gap, left open on
// purpose rather than forgotten: the five mover cards and the legend's
// aggregate are not tied to anything, and they are the likeliest to
// drift — a card's sentence is assembled from several fields, so any one
// of them can change meaning while the sentence reads the same. See
// "Two things that must agree" in DESIGN.md.
