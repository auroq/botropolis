// The documentation structure is checked by tools/check-docs, which make lint
// invokes. That dependency is one line in a Makefile with nothing guarding it:
// delete it and six checks go quiet at once behind a green gate. Asserting the
// dependency from inside the thing it invokes would be circular, and grepping
// the Makefile is a string match on a build file, so this is the other answer —
// a second, independent way in. The checks then survive losing either caller.
//
// This repo has already paid for the difference: tools/shrink-pngs sat in the
// Makefile for fourteen revisions while the path that actually ran bypassed it,
// at 6.6 MB of binary. A guard that is not invoked cannot fail.
//
// readDocs exists because a cached test is a test that did not run, and that is
// the same sentence again. Go keys the test cache on files the test binary
// itself opens; check-docs reads the documentation in a subprocess, which the
// cache cannot see. So with an orphaned file present this test reported
// "ok (cached)" while check-docs failed on the same tree — verified. Opening
// every file the script inspects puts them in the key, so any documentation
// change re-runs this rather than replaying a pass taken against a different
// tree. It is not a redundant read; it is the cache key.
