## 4. Phases

Each phase ends with tests green, lint and format clean, a signed commit, a PKGBUILD bump, and a screenshot in `docs/screenshots/` taken by the acceptance test.

### 7 — UI foundation

- Embed a vector font; all chrome through `text/v2`; four sizes; HiDPI scale from the display.
- `pkg/ui`: theme tokens (palette, radius, spacing), panel, card, chip, button, list, tooltip, keybinding row.
  Pure layout structs with unit tests; `pkg/render` draws them.
- Resource strip, footer, hover card and minimap rebuilt on `pkg/ui`.
- Settings: in-app panel (`s`) backed by the same viper config; `reduced_motion`, `render_scale`, `projection`, `parked_days`, `terminal`.
- Help overlay (`?`), hide UI (`h`), screenshot (`p`), reset (`0`), keyboard pan and zoom.
- **Done when** no bitmap-font text remains in chrome, and a 1× and a 2× screenshot are pixel-checked by the acceptance test.
- Done 2026-09-18 (r68–r73); see DESIGN.md "Chrome".

### 8 — City plan

- `pkg/plan`: bounded map, avenue grid, civic centre, rings, one storage district, park blocks, greenbelt, river edge.
  A pure function of the snapshot plus the saved layout; unit-tested for stickiness (a district keeps its block until its ring changes).
- Decoration placed by the plan: trees in park rows, plaza fountain, lamp posts.
  Delete the per-cell hash.
- Streets as a full grid; traffic on a street is the road's data; empty streets carry no cars.
- Fit frames the bounds; minimap draws the plan.
- **Done when** the fit view has no empty field, every decoration can be pointed at in `pkg/plan`, and mullet's parked sessions are in the storage district.
- Done 2026-09-18 (r74–r76); see DESIGN.md "City plan".

### 9 — Art pipeline and art pass

- First step: render one district through the pipeline and put it beside `docs/screenshots/r64-fit.png`; the rest of the pass waits on that comparison.
  Done 2026-09-18: `make kit-district` renders `docs/screenshots/r80-kit-district.png` from the Commercial, Roads and Industrial kits; awaiting Aria's comparison.
- `tools/render-sprites`: Blender headless script renders each kit piece (and the modelled drone) at four headings and N zoom levels into atlases with a JSON manifest,
  with a size budget per atlas; `make sprites` regenerates; atlases committed with the packs' licences.
- Building recipes per state and fill (ground floor, storeys, roof) from the city kits; landmark recipes from Industrial;
  rover worker sheet with bob and wheel spin; drone sheet; cars, trains, cranes, lamps, sparks re-cut.
- Four headings on `r`; smooth zoom.
- Map view (low zoom) redrawn to match the palette.
- **Done when** the city reads at fit, at detail, and at night without a label, and every building state is distinguishable at map view.
- Done 2026-09-18 (r80–r85); see DESIGN.md "Sprite pipeline". Not cut: the train (the poles and sparks stay, as §3 allows) and the Watercraft kit (the river is a strip).

### 10 — Parity

- Sidebar (`b`): projects with live/needs-you counts, sessions per project by urgency, hidden projects, selected-session card with actions.
- Actions on the map and the card: attach, resume, stop, new session here (`c`), reveal folder, copy path, hide project, star.
  All through `pkg/control` and the `claude` CLI.
- Hide project (map-only, `layout.json`) and star (map-only) — never written to `~/.claude`.
- Name plates only for districts with something happening; otherwise on hover.
- Day/night by the clock (`Live`), with a scrub; lamps keep meaning awake, so night and unattended stop sharing a signal (§5).
- Merged PR: flag turns green with a one-shot celebration; API error keeps smoke.
- **Done when** every row in §1 with a gap reads "—".
- Done 2026-09-18 (r77–r86); the parity pieces landed ahead of phase 9 on the phase 7 toolkit, the clock and the merged flag after it.

### 11 — Beyond parity

- Breakdown panel on the plant: tokens and ~cost by model, by project, by session, for 1 h / 24 h / 7 d.
- Sparklines: per-session tokens over its life, per-district over the day, city over the week (from the hourly buckets).
- Timeline (`t`): an event log of needs-you, errors, PRs, compactions, session starts and ends, with jump-to.
- Search and filter (`/`): by title, project, branch, state, model; the map dims what does not match.
- Teams as a camp: a team's members drawn together with their lead, from `teams/`.
- Daily budget: a target in config, shown on the strip and the plant.
- "While you were away": the needs-you and error events since the window last had focus, shown on focus.
- **Done when** each item has a hover datum and a test, per DESIGN.md's first principle.
- Done 2026-09-18 (r87–r92); see DESIGN.md "Beyond parity".

### 12 — Ship

- Publish `botropolis-git` to the AUR; release workflow tags and builds.
- README with screenshots from `docs/screenshots/`, a 30-second GIF, and the shell helper up front.
- Wayland check (Ebitengine via GLFW/X11 under XWayland today); note it.
- First-run: `botropolis doctor` reports daemon, hooks, terminal, harnesses.
- Done 2026-09-18 (r93–r95) except publishing, which is Aria's call; see DESIGN.md "Ship". `--headless` was added for screenshots and recordings that never open a window.

## 7. Order

7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12.
The UI foundation comes first because every later phase draws chrome; the plan comes before the art because the art has to be cut for the plan's cells;
parity waits for both so the sidebar and cards are built once, on the final toolkit.
