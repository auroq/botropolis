## 1. Inventory: bot-crossing against botropolis today

| | bot-crossing | botropolis (r64) | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Harnesses** | Claude Code, Codex, Cursor (agent transcripts) | Claude Code, Codex (fixture-tested only) | none wanted — Claude Code only on this machine (§5) |
| Live-process detection | pid probe | pid probe + `daemon/roster.json` attach detection | — (better) |
| Worktrees folded into repo | yes | yes | — |
| Sticky layout | hex tiles, root tile, `colony.json` | grid slots + yard slots + river seed, `layout.json` | — |
| Session states | errored, running, merged, unread, sleeping, idle | needs-you, working, unattended, parked, error smoke, PR flag green when merged with a one-shot celebration | — (no "sleeping" tier: unattended covers it) |
| Context / tokens / cost | none | per session, per district, strip, plant card, fresh/cached split, ~cost | — (new) |
| MCP servers, skills, subagents, teams | none | towers, library, cranes, roads | — (new) |

| Close / reopen without losing the session | no | `--bg` + attach, Ctrl-Z detach | — (new) |
| New conversation in a folder | `C` key, from the zone | `c` key and a card button, plus the CLI | — |
| Archive / hide | Archive thread (walks to ship); Hide repo | demolish (`claude rm`), `prune`, hide project (map-only, unhide from the sidebar) | — (archive-without-delete is parking) |
| Viewed / stop asking | `V` | n/a — needs-you is derived from the turn, clears itself | — |
| Reveal folder / copy path | Finder + Copy path buttons | card buttons through xdg-open and the clipboard | — |
| Next needs-you | `N` flies to it | Tab centres it, Enter attaches | — |
| Sidebar | repo list with counts, threads per repo, hidden-repo list, selected thread card | `b`: projects with counts, sessions by urgency, hidden list, the selected card docked | — |
| Thread card | parked beside the astronaut, follows it, actions on it | pinned beside the selected building, follows it, actions on it; hover shows without pinning | — |
| Name plates | only while working/waiting/stuck, else on hover | only where something is awake, else on hover or selection | — |
| Help overlay | `?` | `?` overlay | — |
| Settings panel | `S`, presets + every knob | `s` panel over the same config file | — |
| Hide all UI | `H` | `h` | — |
| Screenshot / reset view | `P`, `0` | `p`, `0` and `f` | — |
| Camera | Google-Earth drag, tilt, rotate, orbit, pinch, keyboard | drag, eased wheel ladder, fit, Tab-centre, `r` four headings, arrows and +/- | — (tilt is not on the table in 2D) |
| Day / night | scrubbable cycle, Live follows the clock | clock-driven, `[` `]` scrub, `n` night/day/live; lit lamps mean awake | — |
| Planets / quality presets / HDR / shadows | yes | n/a in 2D | not wanted — render scale and reduced motion only |
| Art | KayKit 3D kits, PBR, instanced crew, faces, 15 animation clips | Kenney 3D kits rendered to atlases, rover and drone, cars, sparks | — (§3, phase 9) |
| Ground | terrain, scatter rebuilt around plots | the city plan: plaza, rings, parks, belt, river edge | — (phase 8) |
| Satellites | none | TUI, waybar bar, notify, status table | — (new) |
| Network serving | `BOT_CROSSING_HOST` | none | not wanted |
| Packaging | npm | local `botropolis-git` package, systemd user units | publishing is Aria's call (phase 12) |

Net: the data model, the session control and the satellites are ahead of bot-crossing.
The chrome, the composition and the art are behind it.
