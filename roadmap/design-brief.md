## 2. Design brief: what "modern and intentional" means here

These are the rules every phase below is measured against.

**Typography.** One vector face (Inter or IBM Plex Sans, both OFL, embedded), anti-aliased through `text/v2`,
four sizes (12/14/16/20 at 1×), scaled with the display.
The bitmap font is retired from all chrome; it may survive only as the in-world "map view" label style if it earns it.

**Chrome.** An 8 px grid, one corner radius, translucent dark panels with a 1 px hairline, one accent colour,
and one state palette used identically everywhere — map, strip, cards, sidebar, TUI, waybar class:
needs-you amber, working blue, unattended violet, parked slate, error red, merged green.
No text is ever drawn straight onto the map without a plate behind it.

**A city plan, not a field.**
- The map has an edge.
  The river is the boundary on one side, a greenbelt of designed park blocks on the others, and the camera never shows endless grass.
- Streets are a grid of avenues and cross-streets that exist whether or not there is traffic; traffic is what lights them.
  Districts are blocks on that grid, not plots in a field.
- A civic centre: power plant on the central plaza, city hall and library on it, towers along one edge as a telecom ridge.
  Landmarks have fixed civic addresses; they never crowd a corner.
- Zoning by activity: districts with live sessions take the ring nearest the plaza; parked-only districts sit on the outer ring.
  A district changes ring only when its status changes, and keeps its block within a ring — sticky within the plan.
- The yard is a district: one storage district on the outskirts holds every parked session, grouped by project,
  instead of a shed lot inside each live district.
  A live district shows only what is alive.
- Decoration is placed by the plan, never by a per-cell hash: park blocks get trees in rows, the plaza gets a fountain,
  avenues get lamp posts at intersections.
  If a tree is there, it is there because the plan put a park there.
- Fit frames the plan's bounds plus a fixed margin, so the whole city fills the window at home zoom.

**Motion.** Only meaning moves: sparks on power lines, cars on streets, cranes on roofs, lamps at night, the needs-you pulse.
A `reduced_motion` setting stops all of it and keeps the colours.

**Camera.** Fit is home.
Four headings once sprites have four views; smooth zoom between ladder steps; keyboard pan and zoom.

**Selection.** A selected building has a ring; its card pins beside it and follows it; the card has the actions.
Hover shows the card without pinning.

**Empty and first-run states.** No daemon, no sessions, no hooks installed — each has a screen that says what to do.
